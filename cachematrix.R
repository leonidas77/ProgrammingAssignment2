## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly 
## Pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inver <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    inver <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(invMatrix) inver <<- invMatrix
  getInverse <- function() inver
  list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inver <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(inver)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inver)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inver <- solve(data)
  x$setInverse(inver)
  inver      
}
